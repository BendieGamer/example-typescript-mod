# Example TypeScript Mod
To install first run `npm install ef-example-mod`
## How to build?

You can use typescript to compile your mod.

# 1 - typescript

1. Run `npx ef-example-mod` ( IN A DIFFRENT DIRECTORY, AKA WHERE YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR MOD ) ( Also only run this the first time, as this generates the template files.)
2. Modify your files accordingly.
3. Run `npm run build`

## Notes

Please do not remove /// <reference path="ModAPI.d.ts" /> as it auto removes on js and allows shortcuts/snippets :D
